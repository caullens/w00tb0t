An all in one Discord bot. Hopefully...

To use for your own bot,
* Make sure you have Node installed https://nodejs.org/en/
* To get all required npm modules, type npm install.
* Create a config.json file that contains the token for your bot and a name for your database, which could simply be the name of your bot.
* To run the bot, type node bot.js
* Good luck!
